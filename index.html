            <p>The Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale-Revised (RAADS-R) is a tool used to assist the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in adults. It's designed to measure the presence and severity of autism-related symptoms. This self-test provides a preliminary measure and is not intended as a diagnostic tool.</p>
